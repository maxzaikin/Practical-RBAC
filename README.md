# Practical-RBAC

This repository provides practical scripts and examples for implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Active Directory using PowerShell. The focus is on granular permissions, least privilege, and secure delegation of administrative rights.

## Introduction

RBAC is a security principle that grants users access to resources based on their roles within an organization. By implementing RBAC, you can:

* Enhance security by limiting user access to only what is necessary.
* Simplify administration by managing permissions based on roles, not individual users.
* Improve compliance by enforcing consistent access control policies.

This repository focuses on practical implementation using PowerShell scripts and examples for Active Directory.
